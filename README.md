##Knowledge Sharing Platform

The Knowledge Sharing Platform (K#) is a platform that aims to develop a sophisticated enterprise knowledge graph using a wide variety of large-scale data sources. To realise this platform, we are developing a set of components for collecting, extracting, transforming, integrating, and updating knowledge sources. 

We have constructed the base knowledge by integrating several linked & open data sources such as Freebase, Wikidata, GeoNames, etc. A set of enterprise data is transformed into a graph-base knowledge base, and then this knowledge is interlinked to the base knowledge.  

Currently, the base knowledge has approximately 4.5 billion entities and 20 billion facts for general-purpose and domain-specific knowledge. Some domain knowledge are already interlinked into the base knowledge, including 1.2 million entities for products and specifications, 24 million entities for entertainment contents, 5 million entities for restaurants and dining, 46 million entities for multimedia contents, and 24 million geo-spatial entities.

We will share source codes and data sets for maintaining our knowledge graph. We welcome additional contributors if you'd like to help out.

Thank you for your interest.
